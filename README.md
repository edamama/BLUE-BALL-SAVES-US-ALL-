# Installation
Download the files as seen above. Launch the game using "practicegame.exe"


# Controls

Use the Up/Down Arrow Keys to move Blue Ball. He can be moved in mid-air as well.

# Tips
Taking your hand off the keyboard will allow Blue Ball to slow down. Use this if the movement begins to get out of control.

Blue Ball is very bouncy! Use the floor and the ceiling to ricochet him quickly to high and low places
